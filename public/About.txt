Hello, I'm Armbel, a BSIT student with a passion for woodworking. Over the years, I've developed my skills in this field, constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities for growth. Woodworking has become more than just a hobby for me; it's a creative outlet where I can bring my ideas to life. Aside from my studies and work, I have a diverse range of interests that keep me engaged. In my free time, you'll often find me immersed in woodworking projects, exploring the intricacies of crafting unique pieces. I also have a fascination with mushroom farming, delving into the wonders of nature through cultivating fungi. And when I want to unwind, I find solace in fishing, appreciating the tranquility that comes with it. I'm excited to share my knowledge and experiences with others who share a similar passion for woodworking or are simply interested in learning more. I'm always open to new discussions and collaborations, so feel free to connect with me. Let's embark on this woodworking journey together.
